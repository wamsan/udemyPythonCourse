# Your job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system.
# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇
#separate input into single integer digits and put it in a list
x = [int(i) for i in str(position)]

#assign first index into column value
column = x[0]-1

#assign second index into row value
row = x[1]-1

#assign X to mark the spot in map
map[row][column] = "X"



#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
